# cloud-resources

This folder contains example snippets for when you want to use real cloud resources in your Velocity environments.

By including the relavant cloud resource module in your app solution, Velocity will automatically provision the cloud resource for you, and allow your app to work with it.

For an example of such an integration, please see [aws/sample-helm](../../getting-started/aws/sample-helm) or [gcp/sample-helm](../../getting-started/gcp/sample-helm).
