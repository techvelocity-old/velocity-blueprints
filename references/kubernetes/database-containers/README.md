# database-containers

This folder contains example snippets for when you want to use a database as a container.

You can start by copying and pasting the relevant DB yaml file in your app solution and integrating it with your Velocity app.

For an example of such an integration, please see [aws/sample-helm](../../getting-started/aws/sample-helm) or [gcp/sample-helm](../../getting-started/gcp/sample-helm).
